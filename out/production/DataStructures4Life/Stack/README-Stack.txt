Stack in JAVA Collections
-------------------------
Stack -> Vector -> List -> Collection
ArrayDeque -> Deque -> Queue -> Collection

Always prefer using "ArrayDeque" for stack implementation, especially in single
threaded environment.

Because "Stack" implements "Vector" class, which is thread-safe class & legacy class.
