Dynamic Programming
-------------------
Dynamic Programming is an optimization over plain recursion.
and the idea is to re-use the solutions of sub problems, when there are overlapping sub problems.

There are two ways to implement dynamic programming -
1. Memoization (Top-Down)
2. Tabulation (Bottom-Up)

Application of Dynamic Programming
----------------------------------
1. Bellman Ford Algorithm
2. Floyd Warshall Algorithm
3. Diff Utility (Longest Common Subsequence [LCS])
4. Search close words (Edit distance problem)
5. Resource Allocation (0-1 Knapsack)

Memoization
-----------
- In memoization we change the time complexity of a problem from exponential to liner time.
- Main focus in Dynamic problem is to come up with recursive solutions which have overlapping sub-problems.
- Main idea of DP is, if you have computed once, then don't compute again.
