Graph Data structure
--------------------
Tree data structure is mostly use for parent-child relationship.
For friend relationship we use Graph data structure.

G = (v,e)
where,
v - no. of vertices
e - no. of edges

Directed vs Undirected Graphs
-----------------------------
In an undirected graph if we write (v1, v2) which means, we can go from v1 to v2
and also we can go from v2 to v1.

Degree of Undirected Graph - No. of edges going through it.


Real life example -
a) A social network


In a Directed graph if we write (v1, v2) which means, we can only go from v1 to v2.
Real life example -
a) World Wide Web

Degree of Directed Graph -
Indegree - No. of edges coming into it.
Outdegree - No. of edges going away from it.

Term related to Graph
---------------------
Walk - When you start from vertex and traverse the Graph but steps on visited Vertex again.
eg - v1, v2, v4, v2

Path - When you never steps on visited vertex.
eg - v1, v2, v4

Cyclic - if there exists a walk which starts and end on same vertex.

Weighted - Here we have weights assigned to edges, it can be directed or undirected.
eg - Connected cities where weight of edges represents distance between cities.
Also computer networks are good examples for the same.
