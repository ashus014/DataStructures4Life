Hashing mainly used to implement Dictionaries, where we have key-value pairs.
Also used to implement SETS where we have only Set of keys.

Hashing provides Search, Insert & Delete in O(1) time.

Hashing only have unique values, no duplicates allowed.

If a key already exists and if you try to insert value, it will override the previous key.

All other data structures are beaten by Hashing when we have these (Search, Insert & Delete) operations.
Eg-
Array -

[Search]
If the Key are in unsorted order, the searching going to be O(n) i.e., Linear time.
If the Key are in sorted order, the searching going to be O(logn)

[Insert]
To insert you'll have to move, so O(n)

[Delete]
Same reason as above
