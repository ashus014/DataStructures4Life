----------------------------------
    Tree represents hierarchy
----------------------------------
1. A company organization structure
2. File hierarchy structure
3. Top node is called root node
4. The node at bottom of the tree is called leaf node.
5. Tree data structure is recursive in nature.
6. Degree of a node is no. of children it has.

----------------------------------------
    Application of Tree data structure
----------------------------------------
- Represent hierarchical data structure.
- Binary Search Tree
- Binary Heap (Mainly used in Priority Queues)
- B & B+ tree in DBMS
- Spanning & shortest path tree
- Parse Tree, Expression Tree

----------------------------------------
    Tree Traversal
----------------------------------------
Printing every key of the tree exactly once.

Tree traversal can be divided into two types -
1. Breadth First - Visit Root, print root, visit next level, print next level elements
2. Depth First - We go to one side, we finish it completely & then go to other side.

Inorder-PreOrder-PostOrder is done only during DFS traversal
Inorder -> left-root-right
PreOrder -> root-left-right
PostOrder -> left-right-root

----------------------------------------
    Height of Binary Tree
----------------------------------------
Max no. of nodes from root to leaf paths.

-------------------------------------------
    Level Order traversal OR BFS Traversal
-------------------------------------------
