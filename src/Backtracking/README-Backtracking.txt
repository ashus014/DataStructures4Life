Backtracking
------------

In backtracking we put down the condition while making the recursive call & this condition makes sure that you are not
putting a recursive call during that time.

eg : Given a string, print all those permutations which do not contain
"AB" as a substring.

ans : "ABC" & "CAB" would be out from the possible combination.
